# multilayer-perceptron

This is a multi-layer perceptron created in Go at a very basic level.

Furthermore I will list down basic "definitions" that I might have picked up while developing this , to document and refresh what I have learnt in college. I am trying to incorporate "AI" into my prexisting web dev knowledge base to progress my skill tree.

perceptron : basically a neuron, could be multilayered and is the smallest "thinking" unit which gives a binary output.

ANN : artificial neural network , connect layers of perceptron to make a neural network.

Cost Function :  The difference between the outputs of the network and the training set data points are the main values for the cost function.
